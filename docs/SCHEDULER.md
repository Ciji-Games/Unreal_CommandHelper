# Scheduler

The Scheduler tab lets you create **named batch jobs**—sequences of tools that run in order. Ideal for pipelines like:

> Delete HLOD → Build HLOD → Build Lighting → Cook → Package

## Creating a Job

1. Click **Create Job**
2. Enter a job name (e.g. "HLOD Pipeline")
3. Add steps from the catalog using the "+ Step" buttons
4. Configure each step's parameters (project, map, options)
5. Reorder steps with ↑/↓ or remove with **Remove**
6. Click **Save**
